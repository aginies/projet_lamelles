## Howto

How i get the plan:

* grabed the image from the Mal Vi project 
* converted a good one in [B&W](source/original_wall_BW.jpg)
* "extended" the image to get [correct scaling](source/original_wall_BW_extended.jpg)
* done an estimation of the wall lenght then space between lamelles (6/7cm)
* created a Lamelle_mesure.ods file to store data [first draft](Lamelle_mesure.ods)
* created a plot data file to store some values [data](data.dat)
* created a plot file to see the result
* with my wife we has done some adjustment to increase/decrease some curves, using extreme value, so the initial table was no more usable
* as this was a bit "chaotic" in term of value, and not smooth i used an sbezier function in gnuplot
* when the final layout was nice, i extracted the value from the graph
* with the value i was able to get lamelles lenght
* maximum width will be 20cm, minimal width will 5.5cm
* create some pre-calibrated wedge (from 13.5cm to 3cm) for the curve


## Buying 

* 33 wook planks of oak 250 x 60 cm
* cut by 3 = 99 wook planks 250 x 19.8 cm
* aluminium blade (to curve)

## Tracing

* one Aluminium blade 2.5 cm x 200 cm
* lot of clamps
