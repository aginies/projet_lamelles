## Howto

How i get the plan:

* grabed the image from the Mal Vi project 
* converted a good one in B&W "original_wall_BW.jpg"
* "extended" the image to get correct scaling original_wall_BW_extended.jpg
* done an estimation of the wall lenght then space between lamelles (6/7cm)
* created a Lamelle_mesure.ods file to store date
* created a data file to store some values data.dat
* created a plot file to see the result
* as this was a bit "chaotic" and not smooth i used an sbezier function
* with my wife we has done some adjustment to increase/decrease some curves
* when the final layout was nice, i extracted the value from the graph
* with the value i was able to get lamelles lenght
* to get the
